Processors must also delete or return all personal data to the controller after the provision of services, provide necessary compliance information, and allow for audits by the controller. Additionally, if a processor engages another processor, it must impose the same data protection obligations through a contract or legal act, and it remains fully liable to the controller for the other processor's obligations.

Such assessments are particularly necessary for processing involving automated decision-making, large-scale processing of sensitive data, or systematic monitoring of public areas. Supervisory authorities establish and publish lists of processing operations requiring a DPIA and those exempt from it. The DPIA must include a systematic description of the processing, an assessment of its necessity and proportionality, an evaluation of risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms, and proposed measures to mitigate these risks. Compliance with approved codes of conduct is considered in DPIAs, and where appropriate, the views of data subjects or their representatives should be sought.

The notification should describe the breach's nature, the categories of affected individuals and personal data records, provide contact details for further information, outline the likely consequences, and detail measures taken or proposed to address the breach. Controllers must document breaches, including the facts, effects, and remedial actions taken. When a breach poses a high risk to individuals, controllers must promptly inform affected individuals, describing the breach clearly, providing necessary information and measures, unless certain conditions exempt them from doing so, such as having implemented effective protection measures or when communication would involve disproportionate effort.
