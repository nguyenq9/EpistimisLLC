Post-transfer inaccuracies must be reported to the recipient without delay. Recipients must process personal data according to specified conditions, such as purposes, duration, and recipients, unless prior authorization is obtained for any deviations. International data transfers are permissible if the data subject consents explicitly or if the transfer is necessary for processing purposes, adheres to legal conditions, and ensures adequate protection by the recipient. Specific rules apply for law enforcement purposes, requiring prior authorization or allowing transfers under urgent conditions. If adequate protection isn't presumed, transfers can still occur to protect vital interests, public security, legal inquiries, or defend legal claims, provided they do not disproportionately restrict the data subject's rights. Controllers must inform the Authority about international data transfers and maintain detailed records, including safeguard assessments. Transfers within the EEA or to EU bodies are treated as domestic transfers, and international transfers based on specific treaties continue under those terms until amended or terminated. This comprehensive framework ensures thorough checks, adherence to conditions, explicit consent for international transfers, and meticulous documentation to maintain compliance with data protection standards.",

Processors must maintain similar records, including details of the controller(s) on whose behalf they process data. These records must be in writing or electronic form and made available to the supervisory authority upon request.

This assessment should consider the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing. Controllers should seek the advice of the data protection officer when conducting a DPIA. Such assessments are particularly necessary for processing involving automated decision-making, large-scale processing of sensitive data, or systematic monitoring of public areas. Supervisory authorities establish and publish lists of processing operations requiring a DPIA and those exempt from it. The DPIA must include a systematic description of the processing, an assessment of its necessity and proportionality, an evaluation of risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms, and proposed measures to mitigate these risks. Compliance with approved codes of conduct is considered in DPIAs, and where appropriate, the views of data subjects or their representatives should be sought. If processing is regulated by Union or Member State law and a DPIA has already been conducted, further assessments may not be necessary unless deemed necessary by Member States or if there is a change in the risk posed by processing operations, in which case a review should be conducted.",

The processor must also inform the controller without undue delay upon discovering a breach. The notification should describe the breach's nature, the categories of affected individuals and personal data records, provide contact details for further information, outline the likely consequences, and detail measures taken or proposed to address the breach. Controllers must document breaches, including the facts, effects, and remedial actions taken. When a breach poses a high risk to individuals, controllers must promptly inform affected individuals, describing the breach clearly, providing necessary information and measures, unless certain conditions exempt them from doing so, such as having implemented effective protection measures or when communication would involve disproportionate effort. If the controller hasn't notified affected individuals, the supervisory authority may require them to do so or determine if exemption conditions apply.",

Public authorities may designate one DPO for several bodies, considering their organizational structure and size. In other cases, controllers, processors, or representative bodies may appoint a DPO, mandated by Union or Member State law when necessary. The DPO should possess expert knowledge in data protection law and practices and be designated based on professional qualities. They may be a staff member or engage through a service contract, and their contact details must be published and communicated to the supervisory authority. The DPO must be involved in all matters related to data protection and should receive support from the controller or processor, including access to resources and data. They should act independently, reporting directly to the highest management level, and should not be penalized for carrying out their duties. Data subjects can contact the DPO regarding any issues related to their personal data processing. The DPO is bound by secrecy or confidentiality as per applicable laws and should avoid conflicts of interest. The DPO's tasks include informing and advising on data protection obligations, monitoring compliance with regulations and organizational policies, providing advice on data protection impact assessments, cooperating with supervisory authorities, acting as a point of contact for regulatory matters, and considering risks associated with processing operations.",

These conditions include obtaining an adequacy decision from the European Commission, implementing appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules, or relying on specific derogations for certain situations.
